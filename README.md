# weather-cam-station
uses json API from www.wunderground.com, get a key from here:
http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/ (free for most uses, advanced users will need to pay)

The image I use (webcam) I get from using ispy64, then I save a snapshot of it every 10 seconds to my FTP server, then I display it here.
https://www.ispyconnect.com/download.aspx (also free) but you'll have to pay for an FTP server if you don't have a local one setup.

Easy Peasy and you don't need an expensive weather station!

One day I'll figure out how to add almanac data and other historicals, alerts, forecasts and more.
